# Koopman-Inspired Degradation Model

This repository provides an implementation of **Koopman-Inspired Degradation Model** (KIDM) from the paper [Deep Koopman Operator-based degradation modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095183202400423X).

This example demonstrates how to:
- Simulate the Li-ion battery operated under varying current load;
- Train the KIDM model using the provided dataset;
- Predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL) using the trained model;
- Compute and visualize the eigenvalues of the learned Koopman Operators.
